<h2>About</h2>
This is a repo of me working through some Python problems from <a href ="https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises">zhiwehu's 
repo</a> of Python programming exercises! There are other problems I find online that I'm also going to be doing in addition
to that repo. 

I have also added random problems from various Python books that I have as well. Eventually later on, once I get to be
at that level I'll start adding leetcode problems to help me prepare for coding interviews.
